A significant recent development includes a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen for the sale of the majority of its Alliance Healthcare business, valued at approximately $6.5 billion. This transaction will be reported as discontinued operations starting in Q2 FY2021. Additionally, Walgreens has accelerated its investment in VillageMD to open 600-700 primary care clinics in the U.S. over the next four years. The company continues to face challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted sales, particularly in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, due to reduced customer traffic and increased operational costs.
